# Multi-process-Sync-using-win-32-api
A very common definition of a process is that it is a program in execution. It is actually correct to say like that, as every program or a software runs internally as a process. At any point of time, there are number of processes executing inside the computer system and number of processes will be waiting to acquire the CPU for their execution. So, there should be a provision that will help in choosing the next process to which CPU will be allocated. This is where process synchronization comes into picture. Synchronization of processes is also important as there can be some processes sharing data among them, and if this sharing of data is not done in a controlled environment, then the results may be varying. This will not only produce erroneous results but at the same time question the correctness of the computer system. In this paper, we will implement multi process synchronization on readers-writers problem
which is a classical problem in process synchronization. We will implement it using Win 32 API which is the main set of Windows APIs for creating 32-bit applications.
